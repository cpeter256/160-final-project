		<h1> CMPS160/L Project: Shadow Volumes and Reflection </h1>
		
		Colin Peter and Nikita Sokolnikov<br><br>
		
		Description:<br>
		This project will implement two real-time graphics techniques first used in Id Tech 4, better known as the Doom 3 Engine.<br>
		The first of these are volumetric shadows, a shadowing technique that produces more accurate sharp shadows than more popular,
		modern shadowing techniques, but at the cost of being more CPU-heavy<br>
		The second of these is realtime plane reflection, generally not seen in modern applications due to the high cost of re-rendering
		the whole scene, and incompatibility with curved or rough surfaces<br>
		<br><br>
		
		User's guide:
		<br>
		Controls work the same as for program 3. Program 3 was modified to make shadows using shadow volumes like Doom 3.<br>
		In addition, a mirror was added to reflect the objects
		<br>
		The mirror does not cast shadows, and neither do the walls of the bounding box. The light source is the small cube. <br>
