<h1> CMPS160/L Project: Shadow Volumes and Reflection </h1>
<br>
Colin Peter and Nikita Sokolnikoc<br><br>
User's guide:
<br>
Controls work the same as for program 3. Program 3 was modified to make shadows using shadow volumes like doom 3.
In addition, a mirror was added to reflect the objects, and a transform was applied to make sure that nothing rendered behind the mirror.
<br>
The mirror does not cast shadows, and neither do the walls of the bounding box. The light source is the small cube. <br>
