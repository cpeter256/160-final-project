		<h1> CMPS160/L Project: Shadow Volumes and Reflection </h1>
		<br>
		Colin Peter and Nikita Sokolnikov<br><br>
		User's guide:
		<br>
		Controls work the same as for program 3. Program 3 was modified to make shadows using shadow volumes like Doom 3.<br>
		In addition, a mirror was added to reflect the objects
		<br>
		The mirror does not cast shadows, and neither do the walls of the bounding box. The light source is the small cube. <br>
